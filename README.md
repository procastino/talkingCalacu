An arduino based "calac√∫", meaning a Jack-O Lantern. It uses an [DFRobot DF Player](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299), a [HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569) and an Arduino Nano. Any other arduino could be used, this is not really demanding on the microcontroller side.
Just plug de sensor on the arduino, connect de DFplayer to Arduino and some speakers, put some mp3 files on the card and it's mainly done. Sensitivity is quite crappy, but it kinda works as a dirty fast project.
